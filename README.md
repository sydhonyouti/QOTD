# QOTD
The purpose of this project was to write a UDP client-type application using the Winsock library. This project is a “Quote of the Day” (qotd) client application that will send a command (“sendQOTD”) to a qotd server asking for today’s quote. Upon receipt of the “sendQOTD” command, the server should respond with one or more packets of text that contain the quote. 

To test the project, download the qotd.txt file and qotd_server.exe files. 
- When running the code, connect to your personal IP address. The only commands you can make is 'sendqotd' and 'quit'. Writing the 'sendqotd' will send the user a quote of the day and writing 'quit' will quit the application. 
- qotd_server.exe is to show that you have successfully connected to your IP address
