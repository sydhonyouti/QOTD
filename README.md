# QOTD
The purpose of this project is to give you experience writing a UDP client-type application using the Winsock library. You will create a “Quote of the Day” (qotd) client application that will send a command (“sendQOTD”) to a qotd server asking for today’s quote. Upon receipt of the “sendQOTD” command, the server should respond with one or more packets of text that contain the quote.
